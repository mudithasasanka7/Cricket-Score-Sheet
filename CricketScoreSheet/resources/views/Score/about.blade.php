    About Me
Welcome to my Cricket Score Sheet website! My name is [Your Name], and I am passionate about combining technology and sports to create innovative solutions. As an aspiring web developer, I built this platform to simplify cricket match management and bring convenience to players, teams, and fans.

    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of 
    building Web sites: writing markup and coding.Web development may use content management 
    systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of 
    people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing 
    Web sites.Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting 
    developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer 
    or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between 
    departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of 
    Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack 
    developer.Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in 
    the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization 
    of the Web with Tim Berners-Leedeveloping the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has 
    boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

    Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as 
    graphic design, user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological 
    standpoint. It has become a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the 
    Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, videos and music. 
    The web was announced on August 6, 1991; in November 1992, CERN was the first website to go 
    live on the World Wide Web. During this period, websites were structured by using the 
    tag which created numbers on the website. Eventually, web designers were able to find their 
    way around it to create more structures and format. In early history, the structure of the 
    websites was fragile and hard to contain, so it became very difficult to use them. In November 1993, 
    ALIWEB was the first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB).

    In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, 
    which later became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. 
    Text-only HTML pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen 
    and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the 
    majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach 
    to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C 
    was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common 
    protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability." This discouraged any 
    one company from monopolizing a proprietary browser and programming language, which could have altered 
    the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be 
    seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that 
    later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own 
    HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included 
    tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996 to 
    1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. 
    During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, 
    JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive 
    creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.
